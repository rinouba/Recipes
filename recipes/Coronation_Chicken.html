    <p>
      Coronation chicken is a creamy chicken and mango salad with a spicy
      curried mayonnaise dressing. It is something fresh and different that
      always brings interest and recipe requests. Serve cold with a crisp garden
      or rice salad. This also makes a wonderful sandwich filling.
